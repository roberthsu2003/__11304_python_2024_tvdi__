I read this interesting quote the other day:

>"Her eyes had called him and his soul had leaped at the call. To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life!"

>Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was a moocow coming down along the road and this moocow that was coming down along the road met a nicens little boy named baby tuckoo...

>His father told him that story: his father looked at him through a glass: he had a hairy face.

>He was baby tuckoo. The moocow came down the road where Betty Byrne lived: she sold lemon platt.

>He left her quickly, fearing that her intimacy might turn to jibing and wishing to be out of the way before she offered her ware to another, a tourist from England or a student of Trinity. Grafton Street, along which he walked, prolonged that moment of discouraged poverty. In the roadway at the head of the street a slab was set to the memory of Wolfe Tone and he remembered having been present with his father at its laying. He remembered with bitterness that scene of tawdry tribute. There were four French delegates in a brake and one, a plump smiling young man, held, wedged on a stick, a card on which were printed the words: _VIVE L'IRLANDE_!

We pictured the meek mild creatures where  
They dwelt in their strawy pen,  
Nor did it occur to one of us there  
To doubt they were kneeling then.

1. Crack three eggs over a bowl.  
 Now, you're going to want to crack the eggs in such a way that you don't make a mess.  
 If you _do_ make a mess, use a towel to clean it up!  
2. Pour a gallon of milk into the bowl.  
 Basically, take the same guidance as above: don't be messy,but if you are, clean it up!
